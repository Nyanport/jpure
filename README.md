## It's new but using 90s technology (binary)
### The lovely glitch text :)
```
console.log(jpure.minimise(jpure.binaryGarbage(2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2)));
```
Results will be totally random :) so see what you get.
I got the infinitly long (so long I couldn't include it in my post) [theBinaryGarbageResult.txt](https://github.com/Nyanport/jpure/blob/main/theBinaryGarbageResult.txt) and that was so funny.
<br>
### Why did I start working on this so randomly?
Some how, in the 90s people somehow packed a fully-fledged game, _Pok√©mon Red_. I soon realised that if we could package one of the future games into being super-compressed, but still somehow maintain the quality,
<br>
you wouldn't have to wait longer times to download.
<br>
I assume this probably can't happen, but I am experimenting and playing around with binary code.
<br>
<br>
Many new crazy, experimental features await till the point while we will be able
<br>
to create a engine to run programs in binary:
example:
1 byte could be 1 of 256 functions and `1111` could be the opening and closing brackets, this whole concept interests me and excites me.
<br>
But for now this is just a experiment, don't get too excited. ;)
